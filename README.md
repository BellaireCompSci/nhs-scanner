# Usage
- To run the ID scanner, simply click on the Run_Scanner file.
- ID numbers can either be scanned with a barcode scanner or manually entered.
- To end the program, just click the X in the corner and click "Terminate"

# Important Information
- The program creates a CSV file in the same folder as Run_Scanner that contains the date, name, and ID number of all students scanned in a given session. This file can be viewed with Excel.
- The list of all student information is saved in the data folder. To update this list, ensure it has the same name and columns as the original file.
